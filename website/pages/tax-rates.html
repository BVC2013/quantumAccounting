                    <h2>Current Tax Rates</h2>
                    <p>Understanding current tax rates helps with planning and decision-making. Here's an overview of current federal tax rates. State rates vary by state.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Federal Income Tax Rates (2024)</h3>
                    <p>Federal income tax uses a progressive rate structure with different brackets for different filing statuses. Rates and brackets are subject to annual adjustments for inflation.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Tax rates and brackets change annually. Consult current year tax tables for exact rates and brackets.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Capital Gains Tax Rates</h3>
                    <p>Long-term capital gains (assets held more than one year) are generally taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.</p>
                    
                    <h3>State Tax Rates</h3>
                    <p>State income tax rates vary significantly by state. Some states have no income tax, while others have progressive rate structures.</p>
