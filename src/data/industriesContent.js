    summary: "Retail Accounting Services provides industry-aware accounting, tax, and reporting discipline designed to improve margin visibility, cash control, and compliance reliability. Retail businesses often face operational complexity that creates reporting delays, weak controls, and limited decision confidence when financial processes are not structured. Quantum delivers a governance-first, control-driven approach grounded in Clarity, Consistency, Compliance, Communication, Control, and Comprehensiveness, translating daily activity into consistent, audit-ready reporting. Where technology platforms are used (POS, e-commerce, inventory, and payment systems), we manage tool-related risk—data accuracy, integrations, access, and configuration drift—by helping select fit-for-purpose tools and implementing a governance framework that keeps reporting defensible and scalable.",
